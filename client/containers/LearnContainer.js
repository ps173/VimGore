     Learning Vim is not that hard. We are here to help you. Think of vim
     as a essential skill to help you with coding faster Even if you are
     fast enough now and don't think that you want to try it I would still
     recommend you trying it. Atleast try the vim-modal editing. Modal
     editing is way of treating text as a editable document.
